# JOBJOB - "Tinder" for Recruitment

## Project Description

JOBJOB is an application that connects employers and job seekers, using a dating app-like interface to maximize connection speed and eliminate bias in recruitment. The project aims to create a fair, transparent, and secure recruitment environment. JOBJOB's AI algorithms are trained on diverse data to avoid biases related to gender, race, age, or education level, while also providing detailed information on the reasons behind candidate or job recommendations. The solution includes editing language in job descriptions to remove biased terms and summarizing candidate profiles, focusing on skills and abilities. The application uses a "swipe left, swipe right" method to connect employers and job seekers, saving time and enhancing communication. JOBJOB also protects personal data, complies with privacy regulations, and supports multiple languages, creating a modern, fair, and efficient recruitment platform.
